            <p>How much do governments censor the media during political protests? Has that changed with the use of social media by populations? This digital project attempts to track the differences in media coverage during the Turkish protests during the summer of 2013.</p><br />

        <h1>Crowdsourcing Social Media</h1>
            <div class="contentText">
        <p>I first noticed the discrepancies in media coverage when I was living in Turkey that summer, and the massive use of Twitter Facebook, and other digital technologies to organize and alert other people of the ongoing events during the protests. Turkish media was largely dismissed as corrupt, skewed or incorrect. Rather, people relied on <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/middleeast/2013/06/03/amid-turkey-unrest-social-media-becomes-a-battleground/">social media</a> to get accurate and timely information on what was happening on the ground.</p><br /></div>
        
         <h1>Need for Awareness</h1> 
            <div class="contentText">
          <p>Only last month, in February 2014, the Turkish AKP government passed a new internet policy bill, Law 5651, that effectively stifles online forms of dissent and expression. This bill allows website blocking without individual consent or a court order, and allows mass surveillance of Internet users by the government. <a href="http://en.rsf.org/turkey-parliament-urged-to-rejected-18-01-2014,45745.html">Reporters Without Borders</a> called for the rejection of this bill earlier this year to no avail.</p></div><br />
        
        <h1>The Time Map</h1>
            <div class="contentText">
         <p>The digital project attempts to geo-map the events of the first 10 days of the Turkish protests (roughly May 28th, 2013 to June 12th, 2013) on a geographic timeline. The map will show videos, photos and news reports of the protests, the police brutality, and lack of media coverage.</p><br />  
         
         <p>As a form of data journalism, the map will allow viewers to see and compare images of the protests and police violence. These photos and videos were sourced from the occupgezi.tumblr, Twitter, or local blogs. These are contrasted with international news reports from Al Jazeera, The Guardian and the NY Times. Ultimately, the digital map will show that media censorship is indeed an ongoing issue, and shows how people are bypassing state corruption with social media to fight for greater rights. By censoring social media and the internet, the Turkish government is creating an environment where true democracy is suppressed.</p></div><br />
